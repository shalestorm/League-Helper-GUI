This is my first crack at a GUI
This is a really early example of some of my work
The basic idea is a League of Legends companion tool - largely predating some of the standards a companion app should contain
Hence the very bare bones visuals and function
It's mostly a demo on the usage of Tkinter as a whole and some of the capabilies it has a system for designing a GUI

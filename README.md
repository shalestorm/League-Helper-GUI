# League of Legends Companion App
This was a passion project i worked on back in my freshman year of college when persuing my CS degree. The idea was to create a small companion app for the MOBA League of legends.
The app gives deatils of what champion your or your allies should select based on the enemy teams picks and roles, what champions you should ban based on YOUR counters as well as your teammates.
As well as deliver a Tkinter based UI along with it

## Why is it deprecated
For starters it was just a very early project, at the time - a Young me dabbling around and really just using it as a sandbox for learning Python. Since then my fundamentals just grew, and the practices used here - although working
are far from the standards I hold of myself today.
***Then why not update it?*** The understaking would honestly require a full reset. At the time i had not developed any skills in proper OOP, nor usage of DBM. We are talking thousand line elif chains. Again great project to get
a new dev into coding but the practices used would require far more than a bit of refactoring. ***Then why leave it up?*** I find its good to recognize and own your failures. Its not work that im proud of, but im proud i gave it a shot!
***Would you consider a new approach for the same project*** Maybe? Currently however as it stands now there are a multitude of very well optimized Companion apps for the game -  When i first started working on it however - to my knowledge
there just wasn't. Thinks like U.gg's companion app, or Porofessor are already very well developed robust companion apps, perhaps i can pat myself on the back for being ahead of the curve before the project was depracated, but as there isnt
a Problem unsolved, that I have the idea to fill in the blanks within this space - I'll leave it to those who have!
